## Installation

The user must download the files from this repository. Those can be accessed [here](https://github.com/patrickhannan/express-note-taker).

Once the user downloads these files, they must open the files in VS Code. In VS Code, the user will run a new terminal. In the terminal, the user will change their working directory to the current directory. 

Run "npm install" to install the app.


## Usage 

Once installed, run 'npm run dev' in order to start a local server with this app. Once typing in the url into the browser for the local host, the user can write all the notes they like, and they will be saved to the json file db.json. They can be saved using the save icon on the top write, deleted with the trash can icon next to the note on the left, or write a new note with the pencil icon.

The app can be opened at the link below to open a heroku server version:
